### Sprint Velocity
To calculate sprint velocity, the team collaboratively assigned story points to each user story as shown below:

1.  Land onto a Welcome (Home) Screen - 1 story points
    
2.  View Account Management Screen with Login Options - 2 story points
    
3.  View a Lobby type layout screen - 2 story points

4. Enter/Paste the Lobby Code - 4 story points

5. See who is in the Lobby - 3 story points
 
6.  View a drawing canvas - 2 story points
    
7.  Copy Lobby Code to Clipboard - 2 story point
    
8.  Option to start a game if minimum players have joined - 2 story points
    
9.  Be able to draw on the canvas - 4 story points
    
10.  Create an Account with a Username, Name and Password - 4 story points
    
11.  Login as a Registered Account - 2 story points
  

Total story points: 28

With a team of four members and a sprint duration of 1 week, the sprint velocity is calculated as:
Sprint velocity = Total story points / Number of team members = 28 / 4 = 7 story points per team member.
